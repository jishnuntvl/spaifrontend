        <p>Indian sports performance often highlights the phrase “so close yet so far” especially in major sporting events like Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games ad World Championships. Among the various factors the mental strength and lack of professional mental support and preparation has often been questioned recently.</p>
        <p>SPAI, the pioneer association of Sports Psychology in India with its affiliation with International 
            Society of Sports Psychology (ISSP) and ASPAP understands the organisational responsibility in 
            turning the tables and letting better podium finish for Indian athletes.</p>
        <p>With the initiation of certification programme, Sports Psychology Association of India aims to 
            provide resources, training and create a platform for sports psychologists to get equipped, 
            grow, develop, network and collaborate for supporting Indian sports. Strengthening collaborations 
            between sports federations, sports academies, training centres, and sports science professionals, 
            could enhance its impact. Additionally, organizing workshops and seminars could help educate 
            coaches, athletes, and parents about the benefits of sports psychology. </p>
        <p>The time and considerable energy devoted to strategic execution of SPAI projects and schemes,
             and diverse committees constituted, which are updated on the website would enable better 
             functioning of the association. The continued publication of our official journal and 
             the organising of the prestigious annual national conference needs to be prioritised and 
             taken up in the best interests and progress of the association.</p>
        <p>Considering the opportune to engage with SPAI, and continued relationship and interactive 
            reciprocal communication lets make our growth more exiting. </p>
